Documenting my way through this project.

CRUD shows up in multiple places across the board, in products, users, orders, and so on. This is a good example of how a single concept can be applied in multiple contexts. The CRUD acronym is a good example of a concept that is both simple and powerful.

Products / Reading / Piping images to the frontend. / pipe ts
Users
Carts
Orders
Addresses
Profile Information
Paypal Integration
Reviews / This would be a great piping operation to get all the reviews for a product.
